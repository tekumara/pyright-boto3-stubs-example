# pyright with boto3-stubs

Demonstrates the use of pyright with [boto3-stubs](https://pypi.org/project/boto3-stubs/).

Create and activate a virtualenv, then install the stubs:

```bash
pip install 'boto3-stubs[ec2]==1.14.47.0'
python -m mypy_boto3
make typings
```

When checking [ec2.py](ec2.py) pyright takes ~7 secs:
